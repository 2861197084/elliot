Elliot is a comprehensive recommendation framework that analyzes the
recommendation problem from the researcher's perspective. It conducts a
whole experiment, from dataset loading to results gathering. The core
idea is to feed the system with a simple and straightforward
configuration file that drives the framework through the experimental
setting choices. Elliot untangles the complexity of combining splitting
strategies, hyperparameter model optimization, model training, and the
generation of reports of the experimental results.

The framework loads, filters, and splits the data considering a vast set
of strategies (splitting methods and filtering approaches, from temporal
training-test splitting to nested K-folds Cross-Validation). Elliot
optimizes hyperparameters for several recommendation algorithms, selects
the best models, compares them with the baselines providing intra-model
statistics, computes metrics spanning from accuracy to beyond-accuracy,
bias, and fairness, and conducts statistical analysis (Wilcoxon and
Paired t-test).

Elliot aims to keep the entire experiment reproducible and put the user
in control of the framework.

Installation
------------

Elliot works with the following operating systems:

-  Linux
-  Windows 10
-  macOS X

Elliot requires Python version 3.6 or later.

Elliot requires tensorflow version 2.3.2 or later. If you want to use Elliot with GPU,
please ensure that CUDA or cudatoolkit version is 7.6 or later.
This requires NVIDIA driver version >= 10.1 (for Linux and Windows10).

Install from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CONDA
^^^^^

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com//sisinflab/elliot.git && cd elliot
    conda create --name elliot_env python=3.8
    conda activate
    pip install -e . --verbose

VIRTUALENV
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com//sisinflab/elliot.git && cd elliot
    python3 -m venv ./venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -e . --verbose

Quick Start
-----------

Elliot's entry point is the function ``run_experiment``, which accepts a
configuration file that drives the whole experiment. In the following, a
sample configuration file is shown to demonstrate how a sample and
explicit structure can generate a rigorous experiment.

.. code:: python

    from elliot.run import run_experiment

    run_experiment("configuration/file/path")

The following file is a simple configuration for an experimental setup.
It contains all the instructions to get the MovieLens-1M catalog from a
specific path and perform a train test split in a random sample way with
a ratio of 20%.

This experiment provides a hyperparameter optimization with a grid
search strategy for an Item-KNN model. Indeed, it is seen that the
possible values of neighbors are closed in squared brackets. It
indicates that two different models equipped with two different
neighbors' values will be trained and compared to select the best
configuration. Moreover, this configuration obliges Elliot to save the
recommendation lists with at most 10 items per user as suggest by top\_k
property.

In this basic experiment, only a simple metric is considered in the
final evaluation study. The candidate metric is nDCG for a cutoff equal
to top\_k, unless otherwise noted.

.. code:: yaml

    experiment:
      dataset: movielens_1m
      data_config:
        strategy: dataset
        dataset_path: ../data/movielens_1m/dataset.tsv
        splitting:
          test_splitting:
            strategy: random_subsampling
            test_ratio: 0.2
        models:
          ItemKNN:
            meta:
              hyper_opt_alg: grid
              save_recs: True
            neighbors: [50, 100]
            similarity: cosine
        evaluation:
          simple_metrics: [nDCG]
        top_k: 10
