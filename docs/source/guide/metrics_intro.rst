Metrics
======================

Elliot provides 36 evaluation metrics, partitioned into seven families: Accuracy, Rating-Error, Coverage, Novelty, Diversity, Bias, and Fairness.
It is worth mentioning that Elliot is the framework that exposes both the largest number of metrics and the only one considering bias and fairness measures.
Moreover, the user can choose any metric to drive the model selection and the tuning.
