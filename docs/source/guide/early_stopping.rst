Early Stopping
======================

Elliot is design to conduct hyperparameters optimization with various strategies. This operation could be time expensive
due to the possible numbers of models to compare or the deepest of space exploration for each hyperparameter under test.
Moreover, some models take a lot of time to perform a single round of train due to the inner complexity of their own
strategy.
